# Ensemble-Model-for-Profiling-Fake-news-Spreaders-on-Twitter

Capturing millions of users from all over globe, social media has become one of the most popular means of communication and information sharing. Yet, using social media such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and Instagram is like a double-edged sword. On one side is the easy accessible, low cost and rapid dissemination of information simultaneously to the large audience while on the other side is the dangerous exposure of fake news. The large spread of fake news has the potential for extremely negative impacts on individuals and society. Hence, detecting fake news is the need of the day. To tackle this problem, this paper presents an Ensemble model for profiling fake news spreaders on Twitter which allows using multiple heterogeneous classifiers and combining the results of these classifiers just like a team decision rather than an individual decision. The first step in building the model is to extract three feature sets namely, Unigram TFIDF, N-gram TF and Doc2vec from the PAN 2020 fake news spreader dataset and applying feature reduction on Unigram TFIDF and N-gram TF. Two Linear SVC classifiers and a Logistic Regression classifier are built using three feature sets and are ensembled using majority voting. The results obtained on PAN 2020 test set are encouraging.
